TRELLO is a project built on top of the <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React</a> framework.

This guide will help you get started with a project. Follow the configuration below 

## Requirements

Check the current Node version to ensure it's **`v16.16.0`**:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Terminal">
```sh
node -v
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Quick Start

After confirming that your environment meets the above [requirements](#requirements), you can start this project by following the steps mentioned below:

### Clone project

Clone a project by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Terminal">
```sh
$ git clone https://mygithub.url.com
$ cd my-project
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Install dependencies

Install all dependencies for a project:

:::tip[Package Manager]
When that's done, install the project dependencies.

It is recommended that you use `Yarn` for deterministic dependency management.
:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Terminal">
```sh
$ yarn # or yarn install is used to install all dependencies for a project
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Setup environment for development

Since the project relies on a lot of environment variables,
one needs to create a copy of the `properties.<environment>.env` file inside `/env` folder and save as .env in the root directory:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
copy env/properties.env .env
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Start the development server

Running the Project

```bash
$ yarn start # Build the client bundles and start the webpack dev server
```

This will log a message to your terminal with the URL of your local preview.

:::tip[Tips]
While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`.

However, there are additional scripts at your disposal:
:::

| `yarn <script>` | Description                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn start`    | Starts the app at `localhost:3000` by default                        |
| `yarn build`    | Builds the app in production mode and serves files from build folder |
