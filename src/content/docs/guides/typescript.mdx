Avoid `in-line TypeScript` and type `any` whenever possible.

## Describe your data

You can use TypeScript to describe the shape of objects and functions in your code.
Using the `any` type is equivalent to opting out of type checking for a variable.
We recommend that you avoid using `any` in your code.
Here is an example.

```ts
type Result = "success" | "failure"
const verifyResult = (result: Result) => {
    if (result === "success") {
        console.log("Passed");
    } else {
        console.log("Failed")
    }
}
```

## Use interfaces

An interface is a contract for the class.
If you create a contract, then your users must comply with the contract.
In the following example,an interface is used to standardize the `props`
and ensure that callers provide the expected parameter when using this class.

```ts
import { Stack, App } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from "constructs";

interface BucketProps {
    name: string;
    region: string;
    encryption: boolean;

}

class S3Bucket extends Stack {
    constructor(scope: Construct, props: BucketProps) {
        super(scope);
        console.log(props.name);

    }
}
const app = App();
const myS3Bucket = new S3Bucket(app, {
    name: "my-bucket",
    region: "us-east-1",
    encryption: false
})
```

Some properties can only be modified when an object is first created.
You can specify this by putting readonly before the name of the property, as the following example shows.

```ts
interface Position {
    readonly latitude: number;
    readonly longitute: number;
}
```

## Avoid empty interfaces

We recommend that you avoid empty interfaces due to the potential risks they create.
In the following example, there's an empty interface called `BucketProps`.
The `myS3Bucket1` and `myS3Bucket2` objects are both valid,
but they follow different standards because the interface doesn’t enforce any contracts.
The following code will compile and print the properties but this introduces inconsistency in your application.

```ts
interface BucketProps {}

class S3Bucket implements BucketProps {
    constructor(props: BucketProps){
        console.log(props);
    }
}

const myS3Bucket1 = new S3Bucket({
    name: "my-bucket",
    region: "us-east-1",
    encryption: false,
});

const myS3Bucket2 = new S3Bucket({
    name: "my-bucket",
});
```

## Define standard naming conventions

Enforcing a naming convention keeps the code base consistent 
and reduces overhead when thinking about how to name a variable. 
We recommend the following:

1. Use camelCase for variable and function names.

2. Use PascalCase for class names and interface names.

3. Use camelCase for interface members.

4. Use PascalCase for type names and enum names.

5. Name files with camelCase (for example, ebsVolumes.tsx or storage.tsb)

## Don't use the var keyword

The `let` statement is used to declare a local variable in TypeScript.
It's similar to the `var` keyword, but it has some restrictions in scoping compared to the `var` keyword.
A variable declared in a block with `let` is only available for use within that block.
The `var` keyword cannot be block-scoped, which means it can be accessed outside a particular block (represented by {}) but not outside of the function it’s defined in.
You can redeclare and update `var` variables. It's a best practice to `avoid using the var keyword`.

## Use utility types

`Utility types` in TypeScript are predefined type functions that perform transformations and operations on existing types.
This helps you create new types based on existing types.
For example, you can change or extract properties, make properties optional or required, or create immutable versions of types.
By using utility types, you can define more precise types and catch potential errors at compile time.

### `Partial<Type>`

Partial marks all members of an input type Type as optional.
This utility returns a type that represents all subsets of a given type.
The following is an example of Partial.

```ts
interface Dog {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    breed: string;
    weight: number;
}

let partialDog: Partial<Dog> = {};
```

### `Required<Type>`

`Required` does the opposite of `Partial`.
It makes all members of an input type `Type` non-optional (in other words, required).
The following is an example of `Required`.

```ts
interface Dog {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    breed: string;
    weight?: number;
}

let dog: Required<Dog> = { 
    name: "scruffy",
    age: 5,
    breed: "labrador",
    weight 55 // "Required" forces weight to be defined
};
```
